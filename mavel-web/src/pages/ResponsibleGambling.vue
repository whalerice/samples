  Responsible Gambling <br />
  Think you might be gambling too much? Take the self-assessment test<br />
  It’s important to keep track of your gambling habits - that way you can
  address any issues before they become a problem. We’ve devised a
  self-assessment test to give you some guidance on whether you are at risk of
  developing a potential issue. It’s fully anonymous and your answers won’t be
  recorded.<br />

  Set a deposit limit<br />
  Research shows that problem gambling may occur less if users decide in advance
  how much money they want to commit to play. Therefore, we offer you the chance
  to set a deposit limit. After this is set, you won’t be able to exceed the
  previously determined amount. The limit can cover a period of a day, week or
  month and can easily be changed. Set a deposit limit today.<br />

  Self-exclude<br />
  If you think you need to take a break from gambling, we offer self-exclusion
  options too. Choose from 24 hours, 7 days or 6 months - during this period you
  won’t be able to log in to your account or gamble<br />

  Underage gambling<br />
  CASINO only accepts customers over 18 years of age. To diminish the chance of
  underage gambling, we ask for identification and Documentation if we suspect a
  customer is under 18. Although we dedicate a lot of time and resources to
  ensure there are no minors playing, we feel this prevention works best as a
  shared responsibility between us and the minor’s parents/guardians.<br />
